Out of the box, when time is logged on timesheets, Analytic Items are generated for the corresponding costs.

This feature generates journal entries for WIP and variances versus the quantities/amounts expected to be consumed for each Project Task.

The planned amounts are calculated based on the Task "Planned Hours" and the unit cost for the linked Sales Order Line Product.
